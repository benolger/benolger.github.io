            <h2>About UX Mix</h2>
            <p class="lead-in"><em>UX Mix aims to provide the UX community with templates, tutorials and other useful content. Development of UX Mix was done in Ruby on Rails.</em></p>
            <h3>Project progress</h3>
            <p>When I first started tackling UX projects in graduate school, one of the first problems I encountered was creating deliverables that felt client-ready. Unlike development where you could easily find open source code, there wasn't anything to use as a base for my UX work. I also found myself spending a lot of time learning about the various ways to express my design ideas outside of my coursework. I had a really difficult time finding a resource that provided me with a list of options available, and when it makes sense to use them.</p>
            <p>The goal of UX Mix is to release content that helps these newcomers, as well as provide thought pieces that would interest more seasoned UX professionals. Since I started my career the UX community has grown and there are many more resources available, but I would still like to contribute to what's out there. I created the initial design for this project in Illustrator, and used Ruby on Rails for development. Though Wordpress may have made more sense as a platform, I wanted to spend more time learning Rails. I've deployed the site with placeholder content on Heroku.</p>

            <h3>Next steps</h3>

            <p>At this time I&#39;ve shelved UX Mix to focus on other work. If I return to this project I&#39;d like to implement a few more features prior to launching. Tagging posts, search functionality, post archival and social media integration stand out to me as must haves. It would also be incredibly helpful to have collaborator. If you are interested in working together on this or another project feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:benjaminolger@gmail.com">benjaminolger@gmail.com</a>.</p>
